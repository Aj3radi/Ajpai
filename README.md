# PaiBloxx
I love the idea of MyBloxx, but it had way too many problems. Multiple users reported problems including bootloops and lingering effects after uninstalling. Personally, MyBloxx broke my WiFi when I tried it. So I decided to take the good parts of MyBloxx and leave the dangerous aspects such as modifying daemons. 

You can think of PaiBloxx as "MyBloxx but safer." It changes only what is needed to achieve the intended purpose-- blocking ads. Additionally, PaiBloxx uses a symlink to /var/mobile/Media so you can even disable it in a non-jailbroken state if needed.

You can configure PaiBloxx using pbx in NewTerm or the preferences-- there is also a CC module to enable/disable with one tap.
